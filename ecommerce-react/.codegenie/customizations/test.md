# Testing Practices Cheat Sheet

## Testing Libraries
- Jest: Primary testing framework
- React Testing Library: For rendering and interacting with React components

## Test Structure
- Tests are defined using the `test` function
- Each test is an independent unit

## Component Rendering
- Components are rendered using the `render` function from React Testing Library
```javascript
render(<App />);
```

## Element Selection
- Elements are selected using `screen` methods from React Testing Library
- Common selectors:
  - `getByText`: Selects elements by their text content
```javascript
const linkElement = screen.getByText(/learn react/i);
```

## Assertions
- Assertions are made using Jest's `expect` function
- Common matchers:
  - `toBeInTheDocument`: Checks if an element is present in the document
```javascript
expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
```

## Regular Expressions
- Regular expressions are used for flexible text matching
```javascript
/learn react/i
```

## No Mocking/Stubbing Observed
- The provided test does not use any mocking or stubbing techniques

## No Fake Implementations Observed
- The provided test does not use any fake implementations

## Test Naming
- Tests are named descriptively to indicate what they're checking
```javascript
test('renders learn react link', () => {
  // ...
});
```

## Note on Completeness
- This cheat sheet is based on a single test file and may not represent all testing practices in the codebase
